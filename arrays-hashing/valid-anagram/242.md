# 242

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 \* 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## Notes

## Try 1

Time complexity: Sorting the list using the sorted() function has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input string s. The sorted() function performs a comparison-based sorting algorithm, typically using an algorithm like Timsort, which has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

Space complexity: The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. In this line, you convert the string s into a list using list(s.strip("")). This creates a new list containing the characters of s with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. The space required for this list is proportional to the length of s. Then, the sorted() function creates a new sorted list, which also requires additional space proportional to the length of s. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
