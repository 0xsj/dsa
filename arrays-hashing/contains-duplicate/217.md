Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Notes

The space complexity of the brute force solution is O(1) because it does not use any additional data structures that grow with the input size. The space required remains constant regardless of the length of the input list.

The time complexity of the brute force solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because there are two nested loops that iterate over the list. The outer loop runs n times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs (n - i) times, where i is the current index of the outer loop. As a result, the total number of comparisons performed is roughly (n \* (n - 1)) / 2, which simplifies to (n^2 - n) / 2. In Big O notation, this is represented as O(n^2).
